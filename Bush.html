    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" target="_blank">Dr. Vannevar Bush</a> describes in this
        article how
        much knowledge people have gathered over the years, and how
        useful means to store this knowledge would be. He claims it would be scientist’s role to make their knowledge
        more accessible to people.</p>
    <p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_(philosophe)" target="_blank">sir Francis Bacon</a> said:
        “Knowledge is
        Power”. But everyone should have access to this knowledge. Otherwise,
        scientist’s role would be useless. And it is quite fascinating to see how Dr. Vannevar Bush predicted what would
        become later our future devices which would allow us to store information. </p>
