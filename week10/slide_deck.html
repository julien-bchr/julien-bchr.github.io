                                Olia Lialina is a Russian-born new media artist, curator, and writer, who has been
                                living and working in Germany since the 1990s. She was born on April 4, 1971, in Moscow,
                                Russia. Lialina began her career in the early 1990s, when the internet was still in its
                                infancy, and quickly established herself as a pioneer of net art. She is considered one
                                of the founders of the net.art movement, which sought to explore the creative
                                possibilities of the internet as a medium of artistic expression.

                            </p>

                            <p class="bio2"> Lialina's early works, such as "My Boyfriend Came Back From The War"
                                (1996), were groundbreaking in their use of the internet as a platform for storytelling
                                and interactive art. The work consists of a series of animated GIFs and text fragments,
                                which tell the story of a woman's reunion with her boyfriend after he returns from
                                military service. The work was hailed as a masterpiece of net art and is now considered
                                a classic of the genre.

                                Use of the internet as a medium of artistic expression.
                            </p>

                            <p class="index2"> By creating a hypertext narrative that relies on the viewer's active
                                engagement and participation, Lialina challenged traditional notions of authorship,
                                narrative structure, and artistic production.
                                The work invites the viewer to explore the different narrative threads and to create
                                their own version of the story. In this sense, "My Boyfriend Came Back From The War" can
                                be seen as a precursor to today's interactive and participatory digital art forms.
                            </p>

                            <p class="index3">The use of images and texts that are fragmented and out of order creates a
                                sense of disorientation and confusion, which reflects the chaotic and traumatic
                                experiences of war. </p>
